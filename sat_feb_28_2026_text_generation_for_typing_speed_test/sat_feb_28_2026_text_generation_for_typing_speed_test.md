okk so now...i have added two new modes..as you can see....no vowel test...and time test.....so  i need 50 and 50 100 more text for these modes.....criteria is same as before...also they ar like no vowel is easy mode one....and tiime is medium...and time tests text should be large enough so user cant finish typing since finishing before time is akward

## Copilot

Got it! I can see your current repo structure. Your code uses individual files like `data/texts/easy/easy1.txt`, `data/texts/medium/medium1.txt`, etc. But from your earlier message you mentioned storing **one file per mode**. I see the two new modes haven't been coded yet — you're planning to add them.

Let me now understand the full picture:

### New Modes Summary

| | **No Vowel (Easy-tier)** | **Time Test (Medium-tier)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Content** | Random lowercase words, NO vowels (a,e,i,o,u removed) | Meaningful sentences, mixed case, punctuation |
| **Case** | Lowercase only | Mixed case |
| **Punctuation** | None | Yes |
| **Length** | 40–120 words (random mix) | **Very large** (~200–400+ words so users can't finish in time) |
| **Texts** | 50 | 50 |
| **Files** | 1 `.txt` file | 1 `.txt` file |
| **Topics** | Same diverse mix as before | Same diverse mix as before |

Now let me generate both files. The **no_vowel** texts will have all vowels stripped from random words, and the **time_test** texts will be deliberately long so users can never finish before the timer runs out.

you got it wrong?? i alraedy coded them in mode branch..they are all there.... and no vowel i meant  there is vowel and user presses spacebar instead of that vowel and also if possible give me script to run and create 50 vowel1.txt....like this and time.txt also i put them in data folder 

## Copilot



Let me check your `mode` branch to see the actual implementation!Now let me check the vowel_game and TimeTest source files to understand exactly how they load texts:Now I have the full picture from your `mode` branch. Let me summarize what I found:

### From your code:

1. **No Vowel Game** (`vowel_game.cpp`):
   - Reads from `../data/no_vowel_txt/n_vwl1.txt` to `n_vwl25.txt` (but you want **50** files)
   - Text is shown normally, user must **press space instead of vowels**
   - This is **easy-tier** → lowercase random words, no punctuation, spaced

2. **Time Test** (`TimeTest.cpp`):
   - Currently reads from `../data/texts/medium/medium1.txt` (reusing medium texts) — but you want **its own dedicated 50 texts**
   - 45-second timer, `userInput[2000]` buffer
   - This is **medium-tier** → meaningful sentences, mixed case, punctuation
   - Texts must be **very long** (~250–400+ words) so no one finishes in 45s

Now let me update the vowel code to use 50 files, and generate everything:

---

Here are your two text files, plus a script to split them into individual files:

Naruto Uzumaki never gave up on his dream of becoming the Hokage, even when the entire village turned against him. His journey from an outcast to the strongest ninja inspired millions around the world. Through his battles with Pain, Obito, and Madara, he proved that hard work and determination could overcome any obstacle. Sasuke Uchiha, his rival and best friend, walked a darker path driven by revenge, but Naruto never stopped believing in him. The bond between these two defined an entire generation of anime storytelling. Kakashi, Sakura, and the rest of Team Seven grew alongside them, each finding their own strength. The Fourth Great Ninja War tested every alliance and friendship that had been built over years of struggle. In the end, Naruto stood victorious, not because he was the strongest, but because he never abandoned the people he loved. His story teaches us that loneliness can be overcome, that hatred can be conquered with understanding, and that even the most broken person can find redemption if someone is willing to reach out to them.
In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final held in Lusail, Qatar, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe delivered what many consider the greatest football match in history. Argentina took an early lead through Messi's penalty and Angel Di Maria's brilliant team goal, seemingly cruising to victory. But Mbappe had other plans, scoring twice in ninety-seven seconds to force extra time in one of the most dramatic comebacks ever witnessed on the world stage. Messi scored again in extra time, only for Mbappe to complete his hat-trick from the penalty spot, making it three goals apiece. The tension during the penalty shootout was unbearable for billions watching around the globe. Emiliano Martinez's heroic saves helped Argentina clinch the trophy, and Messi finally lifted the one prize that had eluded him throughout his legendary career. The images of Messi draped in a bisht, holding the golden trophy aloft, became iconic photographs that will be remembered for decades. Mbappe, despite losing, proved he is the future of football with a performance that defied belief. This single match encapsulated everything beautiful about the sport and why billions of people around the world dedicate their lives to watching, playing, and celebrating football.
Attack on Titan concluded with one of the most polarizing endings in anime history, sparking debates that will likely continue for years to come. Eren Yeager's transformation from a freedom-seeking boy into one of fiction's most complex antagonists was a masterclass in character development that Hajime Isayama crafted over more than a decade of serialization. The Rumbling, in which Eren unleashed millions of colossal titans to flatten the world beyond the walls, forced every character and every viewer to confront uncomfortable questions about morality, survival, and the cyclical nature of hatred. Mikasa's final choice to kill the person she loved most in order to save humanity was devastating and beautiful in equal measure. The Survey Corps, once heroes fighting for freedom against mindless giants, found themselves battling their own former comrade in a war that blurred every line between right and wrong. Levi Ackerman, despite his injuries, fought on with the same quiet determination that made him one of the most beloved characters in anime history. Erwin Smith's earlier sacrifice in the charge against the Beast Titan remained a haunting reminder that victory always comes at a terrible cost. The themes of freedom versus security, individual choice versus collective responsibility, and the endless cycle of violence resonated deeply with audiences across cultures and languages.
Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer dominated the 2024 Academy Awards ceremony, winning seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, establishing itself as one of the definitive biographical films of the century. Cillian Murphy delivered a career-defining performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing the physicist's brilliance, moral anguish, and eventual downfall with extraordinary nuance and depth. The film explored the development of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project, weaving together the scientific excitement of discovery with the terrifying realization of what that discovery would unleash upon the world. Robert Downey Jr. won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss, delivering a masterful depiction of political ambition and personal vendetta. The Trinity test sequence, filmed without computer-generated imagery, was a visceral and overwhelming cinematic achievement that left audiences shaken in their seats. Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling, combined with Ludwig Goransson's haunting score, created an atmosphere of mounting dread that persisted long after the credits rolled. The film forced viewers to grapple with questions that remain relevant today about the responsibility of scientists, the ethics of creating weapons of mass destruction, and whether humanity can ever truly control the forces it unleashes.
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine that escalated dramatically in February 2022 reshaped the entire landscape of global politics, triggering energy crises across Europe, shifting military alliances that had remained stable for decades, and exposing the fragility of international peace. NATO expanded significantly as Finland and Sweden applied for membership, ending decades of neutrality in response to the growing threat of Russian aggression. The economic sanctions imposed on Russia were among the most severe in modern history, affecting everything from banking to aviation, though their effectiveness remained a subject of intense debate among economists and political analysts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emerged as a symbol of resistance, his nightly video addresses rallying both his own people and the international community to support the defense of Ukrainian sovereignty. The humanitarian toll was staggering, with millions of refugees fleeing their homes and entire cities reduced to rubble by relentless bombardment. The war also exposed the world's dangerous dependence on fossil fuels, accelerating conversations about renewable energy and energy independence. Grain exports from both nations were disrupted, contributing to food insecurity in developing nations across Africa and the Middle East that depended heavily on Ukrainian and Russian agricultural products. This conflict demonstrated that the threat of large-scale conventional warfare in Europe was far from a relic of the past.
Jujutsu Kaisen's Shibuya Incident arc is widely considered one of the greatest story arcs in modern shonen anime and manga, delivering a relentless escalation of stakes, consequences, and emotional devastation that redefined what fans expected from the genre. Gojo Satoru's sealing inside the Prison Realm sent shockwaves through the entire storyline, removing the most powerful character from the board and leaving his students to face threats they were never prepared to handle alone. Yuji Itadori was forced to confront the horrifying reality that Sukuna, the curse inhabiting his body, could take control at any moment and unleash destruction beyond imagination. The deaths of beloved characters during this arc were handled with a brutality that made them feel real and consequential rather than cheap or exploitative. Toge Inumaki losing his arm, Nanami Kento's death, and Nobara Kugisaki's uncertain fate created a sense of genuine danger that permeated every chapter and episode. Mechamaru's tragic betrayal and sacrifice added layers of moral complexity to a story that was already rich with themes about duty, sacrifice, and the price of power. Gege Akutami's willingness to permanently alter the status quo and put every character at genuine risk of death or injury elevated Jujutsu Kaisen from an excellent battle manga into something truly special and unforgettable.
Artificial intelligence experienced a revolution between 2023 and 2025 that fundamentally transformed how people work, create, communicate, and think about the future of human capability. ChatGPT reached one hundred million users faster than any application in history, demonstrating that conversational AI had crossed a threshold from novelty to utility that would reshape entire industries. Midjourney and DALL-E generated billions of images from text descriptions, simultaneously empowering artists who embraced these tools and threatening those whose livelihoods depended on traditional illustration and design work. The cost of training large language models like GPT-4 exceeded one hundred million dollars, raising questions about whether only the largest technology companies would be able to participate in advancing this technology. Code generation tools like GitHub Copilot changed how software developers worked, automating routine programming tasks while sparking debates about code ownership, licensing, and the potential displacement of junior developers. Educational institutions struggled to adapt their curricula and assessment methods to a world where students could generate essays, solve problems, and create presentations using AI assistance. The ethical implications multiplied rapidly as deepfakes became increasingly sophisticated, misinformation became easier to produce at scale, and the line between human-created and machine-created content blurred beyond recognition. Governments around the world scrambled to develop regulatory frameworks, but the technology evolved far faster than any legislative process could hope to keep pace with.
In One Piece, the revelation of Luffy's true Devil Fruit being the mythical Hito Hito no Mi Model Nika changed the entire landscape of a series that had already been running for more than twenty-five years and over one thousand chapters. Fans who had followed Monkey D. Luffy's journey from the East Blue to Wano Country were stunned as decades of mystery about the Gomu Gomu no Mi unraveled in a single chapter that redefined everything they thought they knew about the main character. Gear Fifth transformed Luffy into a figure of pure imagination, his rubber body now limited only by his creativity rather than the conventional laws of physics. The battle against Kaido in Wano was an epic confrontation that drew on years of buildup, alliances, and character development to deliver a climax worthy of one of the longest-running stories in manga history. Oda's genius lay not just in the twist itself, but in how perfectly it fit with everything that had come before, recontextualizing Luffy's powers, the World Government's obsession with his fruit, and Shanks's decision to entrust it to a young boy from Foosha Village. The liberation of Wano Country from Kaido's tyranny was a celebration of freedom, joy, and the unbreakable spirit of adventure that has always been at the heart of One Piece. Luffy's dream, whatever it may fully be, continues to inspire readers around the world who have grown up alongside this rubbery pirate and his incredible crew.
The Last of Us on HBO proved definitively that video game adaptations could achieve the same level of critical acclaim and emotional impact as any other prestige television drama. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey brought Joel and Ellie's harrowing journey across a post-apocalyptic America to life with performances that captured the raw vulnerability, fierce protectiveness, and fragile hope that defined these characters in the original game. Episode three, which focused on Bill and Frank's love story, was a stunning standalone piece of television that moved even viewers who had never touched a controller to tears. Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann's adaptation made the brilliant decision to expand on the game's narrative rather than simply recreating it shot for shot, adding depth to supporting characters and exploring themes of survival, love, and moral compromise with sophistication and care. The infected, particularly the terrifying Bloater and the Clicker sequences, were brought to life with practical effects and sound design that made them genuinely horrifying in a way that transcended the screen. Ashley Johnson's cameo added an extra layer of emotional resonance for fans of the original game who recognized her contribution to the character of Ellie. The series demonstrated that the key to successful adaptation lies not in perfect fidelity to the source material, but in understanding what made the original story resonate and translating that emotional core into the new medium with respect and artistry.
LeBron James broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's all-time scoring record in the National Basketball Association on February seventh, two thousand and twenty-three, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest basketball players to ever set foot on a court. The record, which had stood for nearly four decades and was once considered unbreakable, fell during a home game for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Oklahoma City Thunder. LeBron's career had been a remarkable odyssey that began when he was drafted straight out of high school as the number one overall pick in two thousand and three, immediately shouldering the impossible expectations of being called the next Michael Jordan. His journey from Cleveland to Miami to Cleveland again and finally to Los Angeles was marked by four championships, four Most Valuable Player awards, twenty All-Star selections, and a consistency that defied the natural aging process that diminishes most athletes. The debate about whether LeBron or Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time may never be resolved, but the scoring record provided tangible proof of LeBron's extraordinary longevity and sustained excellence. Beyond the statistics, LeBron's impact off the court through his school in Akron, his media company, and his advocacy for social justice has established him as one of the most influential athletes in the history of sports. Kareem himself was present at the game and embraced LeBron warmly, passing the torch from one generation of greatness to another in a moment that transcended basketball.
Demon Slayer's Mugen Train became the highest-grossing anime film in Japanese box office history, surpassing Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away which had held that record for nineteen years. Rengoku Kyojuro's final stand against the Upper Moon Three demon Akaza was one of the most emotionally devastating sequences in anime history, a masterful blend of breathtaking animation, powerful voice acting, and heartbreaking storytelling. His declaration that none of the passengers on the train would die under his watch, and his unwavering commitment to that promise even as his body was destroyed, embodied the very essence of what it means to be a Hashira. The battle between Rengoku and Akaza showcased Ufotable's legendary animation quality, with flames and martial arts choreography that set a new standard for what anime fight scenes could achieve. Tanjiro Kamado's desperate attempt to help Rengoku and his anguished cries as the Flame Hashira breathed his last were moments that left audiences around the world in tears. The film's success during the global pandemic was remarkable, as people flocked to theaters despite health concerns, seeking the emotional catharsis and heroic inspiration that Rengoku's story provided. His final words to Tanjiro, encouraging him to set his heart ablaze and walk his own path with pride, became one of the most quoted lines in modern anime and a genuine source of motivation for millions of fans facing their own struggles.
The India versus Australia World Test Championship final at The Oval in London showcased one of the fiercest rivalries in international cricket, with both teams bringing their absolute best to the biggest stage the longest format of the game has to offer. Australia's disciplined bowling attack, led by experienced campaigners who exploited the English conditions expertly, put India under pressure from the very first session and never relented throughout the five days of play. Travis Head's magnificent century in the first innings was a match-defining knock that shifted the momentum decisively in Australia's favor, combining aggressive stroke play with intelligent shot selection that frustrated India's bowlers throughout his time at the crease. India's batting lineup, despite containing some of the finest players in world cricket, struggled to build partnerships and convert starts into the big scores that were needed to compete with Australia's imposing total. Virat Kohli, who had carried such enormous expectations from billions of fans back home, was unable to produce the defining innings that the occasion demanded, a rare instance where the moment proved too big even for one of cricket's modern greats. The result underscored Australia's remarkable consistency in International Cricket Council events and raised serious questions about India's approach to overseas conditions and high-pressure knockout matches. The World Test Championship continues to provide the format with a meaningful context that rewards sustained excellence across all conditions.
Wednesday Addams arrived on Netflix and instantly became a cultural phenomenon that dominated social media conversations, Halloween costumes, and streaming charts around the world. Jenna Ortega's portrayal of the iconic character brought a fresh, darkly comedic energy that honored the original source material while establishing Wednesday as a compelling protagonist for a new generation of viewers. The dance scene in the fourth episode went viral almost immediately, with millions of people recreating Ortega's quirky choreography on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, turning it into one of the most recognizable pop culture moments of the year. Tim Burton's visual sensibility infused every frame with Gothic atmosphere, from the architecture of Nevermore Academy to the creature designs that populated the mystery at the heart of the series. The show balanced supernatural detective storytelling with coming-of-age themes, exploring Wednesday's struggle to connect with others while remaining true to her uniquely macabre worldview. Supporting performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia and Luis Guzman as Gomez added warmth and humor that grounded the more fantastical elements of the plot. The mystery surrounding the Hyde monster and the conspiracy within Nevermore Academy kept viewers engaged throughout the season, building to a climax that set up future storylines while providing satisfying resolution to the central conflict. Wednesday proved that classic characters can be reinvented for modern audiences without losing the essence of what made them beloved in the first place.
Climate change continued to accelerate throughout the early and mid twenty-twenties, with record-breaking heatwaves, devastating wildfires, catastrophic floods, and unprecedented storms affecting communities on every inhabited continent across the globe. The scientific consensus grew even stronger that human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial agriculture, was driving global temperatures to levels not seen in millions of years of Earth's geological history. Ocean temperatures reached alarming new highs, contributing to the bleaching of coral reefs that support marine ecosystems responsible for the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people in coastal communities around the world. Arctic sea ice continued its long-term decline, with summer extents reaching near-record lows that accelerated the warming feedback loop as dark ocean water absorbed more solar radiation than reflective ice surfaces. Major cities from Phoenix to Delhi experienced heatwaves that pushed temperatures beyond what the human body can safely endure, leading to thousands of heat-related deaths and overwhelming healthcare systems that were already strained by other challenges. The insurance industry struggled to cope with the escalating costs of climate-related disasters, with some companies withdrawing from high-risk markets entirely, leaving homeowners and businesses without coverage in areas increasingly prone to flooding, wildfire, and hurricane damage. International climate negotiations continued to produce ambitious targets and pledges, but the gap between promises and actual emissions reductions remained dangerously wide, leading many scientists and activists to warn that the window for meaningful action was closing.
George R.R. Martin's universe expanded dramatically with House of the Dragon on HBO, bringing the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons to the screen with spectacular production values, complex political intrigue, and enough fire and blood to satisfy even the most demanding fans of Westeros. The show focused on the rivalry between Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower, two women whose childhood friendship was slowly destroyed by the patriarchal power structures and political machinations of the realm they inhabited. Matt Smith's portrayal of Daemon Targaryen was a magnetic performance that combined charm, menace, and unpredictability in equal measure, creating a character that audiences simultaneously loved and feared. Paddy Considine's King Viserys was a tragic figure whose desire for peace and inability to manage his own family's conflicts set the stage for the catastrophic war that would consume the Seven Kingdoms. The dragons themselves were rendered with stunning visual effects that gave each creature a distinct personality and presence, making the inevitable dragon versus dragon battles feel both epic and emotionally devastating. The time jumps in the first season, while occasionally jarring, allowed the story to cover the years of political maneuvering and personal betrayals that made the eventual conflict feel earned and inevitable rather than arbitrary.
Succession's final season was a masterclass in television storytelling that will be studied and discussed for years to come by anyone who cares about the craft of writing compelling drama. The Roy siblings, Kendall, Shiv, and Roman, tore each other apart in their desperate quest for control of Waystar Royco, their deceased father's media empire, revealing in the process how deeply Logan Roy's toxic parenting had damaged each of them in different but equally devastating ways. Jesse Armstrong's writing was razor-sharp throughout, balancing dark humor with genuine emotional devastation in a way that made viewers laugh and wince in the same breath. The series finale, in which Kendall was ultimately denied the position he had spent four seasons fighting for, was a devastating conclusion that felt both surprising and inevitable, the hallmark of truly great storytelling. Tom Wambsgans ascending to the throne through Shiv's betrayal of her own brothers was a bitter twist that perfectly encapsulated the show's central thesis about how power corrupts and how the people closest to power are the ones most damaged by it. Jeremy Strong's performance as Kendall Roy, particularly in the final episodes, was a tour de force of restrained anguish that communicated volumes through subtle facial expressions and body language. The show's legacy extends beyond entertainment, serving as a sharp commentary on media monopolies, billionaire culture, and the way that generational wealth and power can create dynasties of dysfunction that affect not just families but entire societies.
Erwin Smith's charge against the Beast Titan in Attack on Titan remains one of the most emotionally powerful moments not just in anime but in all of visual storytelling, a sequence that combines selfless heroism, devastating sacrifice, and the terrible cost of leadership into a few minutes that leave viewers shattered every single time they watch it. Facing certain death against Zeke Yeager's barrage of crushed boulders that had already annihilated most of his soldiers, Erwin made the impossible decision to lead his remaining troops in a suicide charge to create an opening for Levi to strike the Beast Titan while it was distracted. His final speech to the recruits, acknowledging that their lives had meaning even if they would never learn the truth about the world beyond the walls, was a profound meditation on duty, sacrifice, and finding purpose in the face of oblivion. The contrast between Erwin's calm acceptance of death and the terror on the faces of the young soldiers he led to their doom added layers of moral complexity that elevated the scene beyond simple heroism into something much more troubling and thought-provoking. Levi's subsequent battle against the Beast Titan, fueled by rage and grief over Erwin's sacrifice, was one of the most viscerally satisfying action sequences in anime history. The later decision to save Armin over Erwin with the titan serum remains one of the most debated choices in the series.
Virat Kohli's century in the T20 World Cup semifinal against Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2022 was one of the most legendary innings in the history of limited-overs cricket, a performance that defied logic, probability, and the mounting pressure of facing India's fiercest rivals on the biggest stage. Chasing a daunting target that seemed increasingly out of reach as wickets fell and the required run rate climbed, Kohli produced an innings of such controlled aggression and mental fortitude that it transcended the boundaries of sport and entered the realm of mythology. The two sixes off Haris Rauf, struck with timing and power that seemed to bend the laws of physics, turned what appeared to be a certain defeat into a moment of pure sporting ecstasy for billions of fans watching around the world. Kohli's celebration after hitting the winning boundary, the emotion visible on his face after years of criticism about his form in major tournaments, was a reminder that even the greatest athletes carry doubts and fears that they must overcome with every performance. The innings was not just about brute force or natural talent, but about the mental resilience and competitive spirit that separates truly elite athletes from the merely excellent. Cricket statisticians will debate the numbers, but for the millions who watched that innings unfold in real time, no statistical analysis could capture the sheer emotional intensity of those final overs. The match cemented Kohli's status as one of cricket's greatest ever performers in high-pressure situations.
The James Webb Space Telescope, a ten billion dollar engineering marvel that represents two decades of development and collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency, sent back breathtaking images of distant galaxies, stellar nurseries, and exoplanet atmospheres that fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe. The telescope's primary mirror, composed of eighteen gold-coated hexagonal segments spanning six and a half meters in diameter, collects infrared light with a sensitivity that allows it to peer deeper into the cosmos than any instrument humanity has ever created. The first deep field image revealed thousands of galaxies in a patch of sky no larger than a grain of sand held at arm's length, each galaxy containing hundreds of billions of stars and potentially trillions of planets, a humbling reminder of the incomprehensible scale of the universe we inhabit. Observations of the Carina Nebula revealed cosmic cliffs of gas and dust where new stars are being born, sculpted by intense ultraviolet radiation into formations of otherworldly beauty that no artist could have imagined. The telescope's ability to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets by studying the light that passes through them during transits has opened a new chapter in the search for potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system. WASP-39b was among the first exoplanets studied, revealing carbon dioxide in its atmosphere and demonstrating the telescope's capability to detect the chemical signatures that might one day indicate the presence of life. Webb's observations of the earliest galaxies, formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenged existing models of galaxy formation and sent theoretical astrophysicists back to their equations.
Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement yet again to create The Boy and the Heron, a deeply personal and visually stunning animated film that won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and added another masterpiece to Studio Ghibli's legendary catalog. The film, which was released in Japan with virtually no marketing or promotional campaign, relied entirely on Miyazaki's reputation and the trust that audiences placed in his artistic vision, a strategy that would have been unthinkable for any other filmmaker in the modern era of aggressive movie marketing. The story followed a young boy processing grief after the loss of his mother during World War Two, drawn into a fantastical world by a mysterious grey heron that served as both guide and trickster throughout his journey of self-discovery and emotional healing. Miyazaki's animation, as always, was breathtaking in its attention to detail, from the way wind moves through grass to the fluidity of water and the expressive faces of his characters both human and fantastical. Joe Hisaishi's musical score provided the emotional foundation that elevated every scene, his compositions perfectly complementing Miyazaki's visual storytelling with melodies that lingered in the mind long after the film ended. The film's themes of grief, memory, family, and the passage of time resonated with audiences of all ages, though the narrative's deliberately ambiguous and dreamlike structure challenged viewers who expected a more conventional animated feature. At eighty-three years old, Miyazaki proved once again that age is no barrier to artistic innovation, delivering a film that stood alongside his greatest works including Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro.
SpaceX's Starship rocket program pushed the boundaries of space exploration further than any commercial endeavor in history, representing Elon Musk's ambitious vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species by establishing a permanent human presence on Mars within the coming decades. The massive vehicle, standing one hundred and twenty meters tall and powered by thirty-three Raptor engines generating over sixteen million pounds of thrust at liftoff, is the most powerful rocket ever constructed, dwarfing even the Saturn V that carried Apollo astronauts to the Moon. Early test flights produced spectacular explosions that provided valuable engineering data even in failure, following the iterative design philosophy that SpaceX pioneered with its Falcon rocket program. The first successful orbital test flight marked a turning point not just for SpaceX but for the entire space industry, demonstrating that a fully reusable super-heavy launch vehicle was achievable with commercial funding and engineering talent outside of traditional government space agencies. The potential applications extend far beyond Mars colonization, including deploying satellite constellations, establishing lunar bases for NASA's Artemis program, enabling point-to-point transportation on Earth, and servicing the growing commercial space station market. The cost reduction that full reusability promises could bring launch costs down from thousands of dollars per kilogram to potentially tens of dollars per kilogram, fundamentally changing the economics of space access and enabling missions and applications that are currently impossible to justify financially. Critics question whether the timeline for Mars colonization is realistic and whether the enormous resources being devoted to the program might be better spent addressing challenges on Earth.
In Chainsaw Man, Denji's chaotic life as a Devil Hunter blurred the lines between horror, comedy, and tragedy in ways that no other manga series had achieved before, creating a reading experience that was simultaneously hilarious, horrifying, and deeply moving. Tatsuki Fujimoto's storytelling defied every convention of the shonen genre, killing off major characters without warning, subverting romantic expectations, and constructing a narrative that felt genuinely unpredictable from chapter to chapter. Makima's true nature as the Control Devil was a revelation that recontextualized every interaction she had ever had with Denji, transforming what seemed like genuine care and affection into cold manipulation that served her centuries-old agenda. The relationship between Denji and Pochita, his chainsaw devil companion who literally became his heart, was ironically the most pure and genuine emotional connection in a story filled with deception and ulterior motives. Power's death, despite the foreshadowing that pervaded the final arc, was devastating because Fujimoto had made readers genuinely love this loud, selfish, and utterly endearing Blood Fiend who became Denji's first real friend. The series explored themes of desire, manipulation, and what it means to live a meaningful life through the lens of a protagonist who started with nothing and was willing to do anything for the simplest of human pleasures. Part Two continued to push boundaries with Asa Mitaka and the War Devil Yoru, introducing new dimensions of social anxiety, teenage loneliness, and the universal human desire for connection.
The global semiconductor shortage that began during the pandemic and persisted through subsequent years disrupted industries ranging from automotive manufacturing to consumer electronics and gaming, exposing the fragility of supply chains that the modern world had taken for granted for decades. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which controls approximately fifty-five percent of the world's contract chip production, became a focal point of geopolitical tension as nations recognized that dependence on a single company located in one of the world's most strategically sensitive regions posed an unacceptable risk to national security and economic stability. The extreme ultraviolet lithography machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips cost over two hundred million dollars each and are produced exclusively by the Dutch company ASML, creating a bottleneck that no amount of investment can quickly resolve because the knowledge and supply chains required to build these machines took decades to develop. The United States responded with the CHIPS and Science Act, investing fifty-two billion dollars in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, while the European Union launched its own chip initiative and Japan partnered with TSMC to build fabrication plants on its soil. Without semiconductors, the modern world simply ceases to function, as these tiny silicon chips power everything from smartphones and computers to automobiles, medical equipment, military systems, and the artificial intelligence models that are reshaping every industry. The race to achieve chip independence has become one of the defining technological and geopolitical competitions of the twenty-first century.
Real Madrid's Champions League comeback against Manchester City produced one of the most extraordinary nights in the history of European football, confirming once again why the Spanish club is synonymous with continental glory and the inexplicable, almost supernatural ability to produce miracles when all hope seems lost. Trailing on aggregate with minutes remaining in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid appeared to be heading for elimination against a Manchester City side that had dominated possession and created the better chances throughout much of the tie. Then Rodrygo happened, scoring in the eighty-ninth and ninety-first minutes to send the stadium and millions of watching fans into delirium, completing a comeback that defied statistical probability and rational analysis in equal measure. Karim Benzema's penalty in extra time completed the turnaround, struck with the calm confidence of a man who had been in these situations before and knew exactly what the moment required. The expected goals statistics for the match told a story of City dominance, but football has never been a sport that respects statistical models when human spirit, belief, and the weight of history intervene. This particular Champions League run encapsulated everything that makes Real Madrid unique in world football, their ability to transcend tactical analysis and produce performances fueled by an institutional belief that they are simply destined to win this competition. The Bernabeu atmosphere during those final minutes was something that transcends sport entirely, becoming a shared emotional experience that bonds generations of supporters.
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is often ranked as the greatest anime series of all time across fan polls, critical lists, and rating aggregation sites, and it earns that distinction through a masterfully constructed narrative that balances action, philosophy, humor, and emotional depth with seemingly effortless precision. The story of Edward and Alphonse Elric, two brothers who committed the ultimate taboo of human transmutation in an attempt to resurrect their deceased mother and paid terrible prices for their arrogance, is one of the most compelling premises in anime history. Edward lost his left leg and right arm, while Alphonse lost his entire body and had his soul bound to a suit of armor, and their quest to find the Philosopher's Stone and restore what they lost drove a narrative that explored the deepest questions about life, death, sacrifice, and what it truly means to be human. The Law of Equivalent Exchange, the fundamental principle that to obtain something, something of equal value must be lost, served as both a literal rule of the show's magic system and a thematic framework that gave every character's choices weight and consequence. The villains, named after the seven deadly sins, were among the most memorable antagonists in anime, with characters like Greed, Envy, and Pride each embodying their namesake sin while also revealing unexpected depth and even moments of genuine pathos. The final confrontation with Father and the resolution of every character arc in the closing episodes was a triumph of long-form storytelling that rewarded viewers who had invested in the journey from beginning to end.
Rafael Nadal's retirement from professional tennis marked the end of an extraordinary era that redefined what was possible in the sport and produced one of the greatest athletic careers in human history. With twenty-two Grand Slam titles, including an almost incomprehensible fourteen French Open championships that established his dominance on clay as the most lopsided surface advantage in tennis history, Nadal leaves behind a legacy that extends far beyond trophies and records. His rivalry with Roger Federer, which many consider the greatest rivalry in the history of sport, produced matches of such beauty, drama, and athletic excellence that they elevated tennis to an art form watched and appreciated by hundreds of millions of people around the world. The 2008 Wimbledon final between Nadal and Federer is widely regarded as the greatest tennis match ever played, a five-set epic that ended in near-darkness and saw Nadal claim his first Wimbledon title after years of Federer's dominance on grass. His rivalry with Novak Djokovic added another dimension to the competition at the top of the men's game, with their French Open encounters becoming annual events that fans anticipated with the excitement usually reserved for championship finals. Nadal's playing style, characterized by extreme topspin on his forehand, relentless defensive coverage, and a competitive intensity that intimidated opponents before they even stepped on court, took a devastating toll on his body over two decades of professional competition. The injuries he endured, particularly the chronic foot condition that caused constant pain throughout the latter stages of his career, made his continued excellence all the more remarkable.
Stranger Things captivated global audiences with its masterful blend of supernatural horror, heartfelt coming-of-age storytelling, and nostalgic references to the films, music, and culture of the nineteen-eighties that created a viewing experience unlike anything else on television. The Duffers Brothers created a world in Hawkins, Indiana that felt simultaneously familiar and terrifying, where the warmth of childhood friendships existed alongside the ever-present threat of the Upside Down and the nightmarish creatures that inhabited this parallel dimension. Eleven, the young girl with telekinetic powers who escaped from Hawkins National Laboratory, became one of the most iconic characters in modern television, her vulnerability and extraordinary abilities making her both deeply sympathetic and genuinely awe-inspiring. The fourth season elevated the stakes dramatically with the introduction of Vecna, a villain whose personal connection to Eleven's past added psychological depth to the horror and raised questions about the nature of evil, trauma, and whether anyone is truly beyond redemption. The use of Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill as a narrative device in Max's near-death scene was a stroke of genius that simultaneously created one of the most tense and emotionally affecting sequences in the show's history while introducing an entirely new generation to an eighties classic. The friendships between Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Will, and later Max and Robin formed the emotional backbone of the series, grounding the supernatural elements in genuine human relationships that audiences cared deeply about. The cultural impact of Stranger Things extended far beyond the screen, influencing fashion, music streaming patterns, and the broader nostalgia trend that came to define much of popular culture during the streaming era.
Quantum computing made significant strides as IBM, Google, and other technology companies announced breakthroughs in error correction, qubit stability, and the development of increasingly powerful quantum processors that brought the promise of practical quantum computation closer to reality than ever before. IBM's Condor processor surpassed one thousand qubits, demonstrating that scaling quantum hardware was achievable even if the challenge of maintaining coherence and reducing error rates remained formidable obstacles that the field needed to overcome before quantum advantage could be achieved for commercially relevant problems. Google's earlier claim of quantum supremacy, in which its Sycamore processor solved a specific problem in two hundred seconds that would take the most powerful classical supercomputer an estimated ten thousand years, remained a subject of debate among researchers who questioned whether the comparison was fair and whether the problem solved had any practical significance. The fundamental concept of quantum computing, based on qubits that can exist in superposition states representing both zero and one simultaneously, promises computational capabilities that could revolutionize drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions at the quantum level, break current encryption standards that protect financial systems and national security communications, and optimize complex systems from logistics networks to financial portfolios in ways that classical computers cannot achieve. The challenge of quantum error correction, which requires many physical qubits to create a single logical qubit reliable enough for useful computation, meant that practical quantum computers capable of outperforming classical machines on real-world problems remained years or possibly decades away. Universities and research institutions around the world raced to develop new qubit technologies based on trapped ions, photonics, topological approaches, and other architectures that might prove more scalable and reliable than the superconducting circuits that currently dominate the field.
The Bear on FX captured the chaos, passion, and pressure of professional kitchen life with an intensity and authenticity that earned it widespread critical acclaim, multiple Emmy Awards, and a devoted audience that found in its frantic energy a metaphor for the universal human struggle to find purpose and connection in the midst of overwhelming demands. Jeremy Allen White's portrayal of Carmen Berzatto, a fine-dining chef who returns to Chicago to run his deceased brother's sandwich shop, was a revelation that established him as one of the most compelling actors of his generation. The show's signature directing style, with extended single-take sequences that placed viewers directly in the middle of kitchen chaos where orders are shouted, dishes crash, and tempers explode, created a visceral viewing experience that was simultaneously stressful and exhilarating. Episode seven of the second season, titled Forks, was a masterpiece of visual storytelling that followed Richie's transformation during a stage at a Michelin-starred restaurant, conveying through action rather than dialogue how dedication to craft and attention to detail can become a pathway to self-respect and personal redemption. The ensemble cast, including Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Lionel Boyce, created a family of characters whose conflicts and bonds felt deeply authentic, drawing on the real experiences of restaurant industry professionals who served as consultants throughout the production. The show's exploration of grief, addiction, family dysfunction, and the healing power of creative work resonated with audiences far beyond those with any connection to the food industry.
Squid Game became Netflix's most-watched series in the platform's history, exposing the brutal consequences of economic despair through deadly reimaginings of childhood games that served as both visceral entertainment and sharp social commentary on the inequalities inherent in modern capitalist societies. Created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, who had struggled for over a decade to get the project funded because studios considered the premise too dark and unconventional for mainstream audiences, the show's massive global success vindicated his artistic vision and demonstrated that audiences around the world were hungry for stories that confronted uncomfortable truths about wealth, poverty, and the systems that perpetuate inequality. The four hundred and fifty-six desperate players who entered the game, each carrying debts and failures that made the promise of winning forty-five point six billion won worth risking their lives for, represented a cross-section of society that included gamblers, immigrants, corporate criminals, and ordinary people crushed by circumstances beyond their control. The visual design of the show, with its childlike colors and imagery juxtaposed against extreme violence, created a dissonance that reinforced the central metaphor of innocence corrupted by greed and desperation. Player sixty-seven's death was one of the most emotionally devastating moments in the series, a reminder that behind every statistic and game piece was a human being with hopes, relationships, and a life that deserved better than the hand society had dealt them. The VIPs who watched the games for entertainment added another layer of critique, suggesting that the exploitation of the desperate for the amusement of the wealthy was not merely fiction but a reflection of existing power dynamics.
Dune Part Two was a cinematic triumph that brought Frank Herbert's epic science fiction saga to vivid, overwhelming life with stunning visual effects, powerful performances, and a narrative scope that matched the ambition of one of the most influential novels in the history of speculative fiction. Denis Villeneuve's direction transformed the desert planet of Arrakis into a fully realized world where the golden sands, towering rock formations, and massive sandworms created an environment that felt simultaneously alien and hauntingly beautiful. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides deepened significantly in this installment, capturing the character's internal conflict between his genuine desire to help the Fremen people and his growing awareness that the religious prophecy he was fulfilling would lead to a holy war claiming billions of lives across the known universe. Zendaya's expanded role as Chani provided an essential counterpoint to Paul's messianic arc, her skepticism and eventual heartbreak serving as a grounding emotional anchor that reminded audiences of the human cost of political and religious manipulation. Austin Butler's performance as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen was a terrifying display of controlled menace that established him as a formidable antagonist worthy of the climactic knife fight that the story had been building toward since the first film. Hans Zimmer's musical score was an immersive sonic landscape that blended traditional orchestral composition with synthesizers and vocals inspired by Middle Eastern and Central Asian musical traditions, creating an auditory experience as distinctive and transportive as the visual imagery.
Formula One's rivalry between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton captivated the motorsport world and extended far beyond traditional racing fans to become one of the biggest sporting narratives of recent years. Their championship battle in two thousand and twenty-one, which culminated in the controversial final lap at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where a safety car restart gave Verstappen the opportunity to overtake Hamilton and claim his first title, produced one of the most contentious conclusions in the sport's seven-decade history. Hamilton had dominated the race and appeared certain to claim a record eighth championship when a late crash brought out the safety car, and Race Director Michael Masi's decision to allow only the lapped cars between Verstappen and Hamilton to unlap themselves was criticized as a departure from established regulations that handed the championship to Red Bull. The subsequent seasons saw Verstappen and Red Bull achieve a level of dominance rarely witnessed in Formula One, with the Dutchman winning nineteen of twenty-two races in two thousand and twenty-three, posting the highest win percentage in a single season in the sport's entire history. The Red Bull RB19 was an engineering masterpiece that found more downforce and less drag than any competitor could match, a testament to the genius of Adrian Newey and the design team that had created a car approximately half a second per lap faster than anything else on the grid. The cost cap regulations introduced to level the playing field and promote closer competition had not yet achieved their intended effect, as the advantage that Red Bull had built through superior design philosophy and wind tunnel correlation proved difficult for rivals to overcome within a single regulatory cycle.

### How to use:

```bash
# 1. Place all 3 files in your TypeDrift project root:
#    - no_vowel.txt
#    - time_test.txt
#    - generate_texts.sh

# 2. Make the script executable
chmod +x generate_texts.sh

# 3. Run it
./generate_texts.sh
```

### What this creates:

| Mode | Directory | Files | Naming |
|---|---|---|---|
| **No Vowel** | `data/no_vowel_txt/` | 50 | `n_vwl1.txt` → `n_vwl50.txt` |
| **Time Test** | `data/time_txt/` | 50 | `time1.txt` → `time50.txt` |

### ⚠️ Two things to update in your code on the `mode` branch:

1. **`vowel_game.cpp` line 155** — Change `% 25` to `% 50` since you now have 50 files:
   ```cpp name=fix_vowel_count.cpp url=https://github.com/AshrafulAbedin/TypeDrift/blob/mode/src/game_modes/vowel_game.cpp#L155
   int fileindex = (current_time % 50) + 1;  // was % 25
   ```

2. **`TimeTest.cpp` line 143** — Change the path from medium texts to your new time texts directory:
   ```cpp name=fix_time_path.cpp url=https://github.com/AshrafulAbedin/TypeDrift/blob/mode/src/game_modes/TimeTest.cpp#L143
   const char base_path[] = "../data/time_txt/time";  // was ../data/texts/medium/medium
   ```

### Text specs:
- **No Vowel:** 50 texts, lowercase random words, no punctuation, spaced, 40–120 words each — user sees normal text but presses **space** where vowels are
- **Time Test:** 50 texts, mixed case, punctuation, meaningful sentences, **~200–400+ words each** — long enough that nobody finishes in 45 seconds!
